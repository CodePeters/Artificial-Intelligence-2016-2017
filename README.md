***How it Works***
This application is used to find the nearest taxi to a certain client. It finds the optimal way for each taxi and the nearest taxi to the client. Then it uses google maps to present the path for all taxis and the optimal-nearest taxi.  

You need to provide the coordinates of the client in client.csv, the coordinates taxi's in taxi.csv and the nodes in nodes .csv. Nodes represent city roads and you can automatically export them into csv using http://www.openstreetmap.org (export them in .osm file) and use QGIS tool ( http://www.qgis.org/en/site/ ) to tranform .osm to csv.

Then simply compile java files and run java project1.

You can find example outputs in Output file. Here is an example:
